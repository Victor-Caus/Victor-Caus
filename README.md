## 🌟 Contributions
Here are some repositories I've contributed to:

- 🚀 **[Machine Learning 3D Rocket](https://github.com/Victor-Caus/Exame-CT-213/blob/main/README.md)** – A machine learning project where, given the relative positions of the next two rings, a rocket should choose its propulsion outputs for each state in a real-time 3D simulation using the Godot game engine. I implemented the neural network architecture, Particle Swarm Optimization, and DQN algorithms in GDScript without external libraries.
  
- ❤️ **[Heart Disease Prediction](https://github.com/Samirnunes/heart-disease-prediction)** – Predicts if a person has heart disease from medical data. I developed the feedback system.

- 🅿️ **[Control System for Parking Dynamic Pricing](https://github.com/Victor-Caus/Control_ParkingDynamicPricing)** – We used classical control techniques to implement public parking dynamic pricing to avoid congestion caused by high vacancy demand.

- 📈 **[Multiple-NN Stock Market Prediction](https://github.com/Victor-Caus/Stock-Market-Prediction)** – Stock market price predictions using multiple neural networks and classical machine learning techniques with the Matlab Toolkit.

- 🧪 **[Design of Experiments](https://github.com/Victor-Caus/Grupo-7-DOE)** – Support software for planning rocket propellant experiments and optimizing factors such as temperature and compound ratios, based on statistical concepts. I developed most of the functions.

- ♟️ **[Genetic 8 Queens](https://github.com/Victor-Caus/8Rainhas_genetico)** – Solves the 8-Queens problem using a genetic algorithm.

- 🏰 **[ITA Tower Defense](https://github.com/gabrielcbomfim/ITA-Tower-Defense)** – A tower defense game themed around ITA life. I modeled the map, music, waypoint movement system, active skills, and HUD.

- 🌌 **[SkyLab: Universal Gravitation 3D Simulator](https://github.com/canhotuctor/skylab)** – A 3D simulator for educational purposes focused on universal gravitation.

- 🌾 **[Harvest Game](https://github.com/gubidubi/Harvest)** – A shooter farming game created for a game jam. I composed the music, designed the raven enemy, and implemented its finite-state machine for AI.

- 🎮 **[Cycle of Life](https://github.com/gubidubi/Ciclo_de_vida)** – A game developed in a game jam. I primarily created the animations and the AI for enemy movement.
